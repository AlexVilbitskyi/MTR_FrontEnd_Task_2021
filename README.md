# MTR_FrontEnd_Task_2021

#First task

#Second Task

I have a few comments on the second task. Here are all the changes I have made:
- resizing and compression images;
- add "defer" to the external scripts;
- load min jQuery instead dev version;
- load image base on screen size.

There is one more thing that we can do:
- minimize Bootstrap via loading only parts we need.

There is one bug:
- Rings section breaks on manual screen resize.

I had a lot of fun doing these tasks. Thank you :) I will also be very grateful for verifications and feedback.
